# Dice_Game
This is a Dice game in which two players can participate. The websites contain two dice having numbers 1-6. One of the players can refresh the page and see the magic happen! The dice will display new numbers as soon as you hit the refresh Page . 4
Although this is a very basic page but I'm all new to Javascript and just trying to getting comfortable in the shoes!
The idea is taken from the Web Development Udemy Course under the instructoe Angela Yu.
The idea is not orginal but the whole HTML,CSS and JS is done by me and to celebrate this first project all by me, I created this repo :)
